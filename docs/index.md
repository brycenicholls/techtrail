# ABOUT ME

```yaml
tail -f /var/log/career
```

My predisposition to take things apart and see how they work began as a child. This has evolved today into a fascination for all things pertaining to technology.

My IT career started in my father’s internet cafe in India while i was still in school.
I broke the Serial over LAN (SOL) network and had to figure out how to fix it before he found out.

My experience now spans technologies such as Networking, vSphere, vCenter, vCloud Director, Openstack etc…

I have built this website with a view to blog about the technologies I use and to write tutorials on how i use those technologies.
