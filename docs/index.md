tail -f /var/log/career
```

I am a Cloud Native Infrastructure Engineer with experience in various
domains in the IT and Telecommunication Industry.
I have experience working in SC cleared cloud environments.

My predisposition to take things apart and see how they work began as a child.
This has evolved today into a fascination for all things pertaining to technology.
